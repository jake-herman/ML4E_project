# ML4E_project
Final Project for MANE 6962: Machine Learning for Engineering

Upon completion of this project, I will have demonstrated the value in using neural networks to solve differential equations rather than using iterative solvers, as seen in classes such as Intro to Differential Equations or Numerical Methods and Programming for Engineers. The key distinction is that these previously explored iterative solvers require datapoints at each iterate to solve the system, while the neural ordinary differential equation solver simply requires a governing differential equation (or a system thereof) and the system's initial conditions. 

Motivations for this project are largely inspired by the course Spaceflight Mechanics, in which we explored governing equations and used them to generate datapoints at each time iterate, which were then used to predict the system at future states. I look forward to work on this project, as it will give me an avenue to explore my passion for spaceflight, as my research focuses largely on fluid dynamics and there are few courses at RPI in the Space Flight Track of aeronautical engineering

## How to run:

Simply load the jupyter notebook with the provided data (or generate new data with the attached Simulink model and respective driver function. 
Comparable data using torchdiffeq can be generated by implementing the torchdiffeq package [found here](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq)
